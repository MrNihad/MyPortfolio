            data-text="Bees have vital importance in our lives, not just in honey production as well as being the primary
            pollinator in nature. Therefore deciding where to put the beehives is very important. Several factors
            influence the bees, such as closeness to water sources, flora(land cover), and proximity to urban areas and
            agricultural fields. It seems like it would be a great idea to put it near agricultural fields because of
            pollination. However, one particular factor has lethal effects on bees, which is pesticides. So agricultural
            fields are not ideal locations for bees. This research aims to find the best locations for beehives in Estonia using multi-criteria analysis. Especially for honey and wax production. This will help future beekeepers to choose the best place for the
            colony.For this research, five main factors were chosen. These are proximity to roads, urban areas, water sources,
            land cover type, and aspects. Each of these has a different effect on beekeeping. For example, beekeepers
            tend to avoid urban areas and choose a location far from roads because of greenhouse gas. On the other
            hand, closeness to water bodies and land cover type significantly impacts bees. Most of the datasets are
            from the Estonian Land Board, and only the land cover data is Copernicus Corine land cover data. As a
            methodology, the vector layers of roads, water bodies, urban areas, and land cover turned into raster data. Before turning land cover data to raster, the classification steps were done. I classified it into four
            categories based on land type. After rasterization, the proximity analysis is done using the proximity
            (raster distance) tool for roads, urban areas, and water bodies. Aspect data was created using elevation data. Then all these four datasets are reclassified into four
            categories using reclassify by table tool. Based on referenced articles, the multi-criteria decision matrix
            was created. The criteria index was 0.06. Table 1 illustrates the multi-criteria decision matrix. The main
            weights put on land cover type and closeness to water bodies. Then the final map was created using a
            raster calculator. Each layer is multiplied by its weight, and these raster layers are added together. As a
            final step, a polygonize tool is used to turn this final raster layer into a vector layer, and statistics by
            categories are used to calculate each suitable or unsuitable areaâ€™s sum.
            Results showed that the most suitable areas are located around water bodies and in forest cover types. The
            criteria for proximity to water bodies were taken from Mohd Noor Maris, N. (2008), and 0-200m was for
            highly suitable criteria. That is why the highly suitable areas are smaller than others. Also, the proximity
            to the road network has influenced it a lot. After area calculation, results showed that 52% of the study
            area is moderately suitable, 40% is less suitable, almost 2% highly suitable, and 5.6% is not suitable. Since
            Estonia has many forest areas, more than half of the study area is suitable for beekeeping. Figure 1 and
            Table 2 illustrate these results.
            The suitable areas for beekeeping in Estonia are analyzed using a multi-criteria matrix. Based on the
            analysis of five factors, more than half of the study area is suitable for beekeeping. However, the highly
            suitable areas contain a small portion of the study area. For future research, the analysis can be conducted
            on more datasets and additional criteria.">
