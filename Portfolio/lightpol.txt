The main aim of this project was to analyze light pollution in the US, look for special patterns, and make awareness of the problem. Light pollution is a serious problem but people don't take it seriously. Light pollution is usually related to population. During the analysis, I encounter one interesting special pattern. Las Vegas Luxor Sky beam. It causes the highest light pollution in the entire US and even in the world.
